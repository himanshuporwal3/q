# Q#

## In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

- A qubit is a basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing.
- Superposition is a quantum phenomena where a qubit is in a combination of both zero and one states. When measured, a qubit goes from being in superposition to one of the classical states.
- You can combine classical code with quantum code. This enables you to perform quantum computations and work with the results, all in the same program.
- A `repeat` loop enables you to repeat a quantum operation until it achieves a specific result.
